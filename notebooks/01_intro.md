# 01. Introduction
Welcome to this tutorial on the Workspaces at the [HuBMAP Data Portal](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/)! This tutorial guides you through how to use workspaces, how to work with HuBMAP data, and how to create your own templates. 

In this first section, we highlight the benefits of workspaces, explain how they work, and show how to set them up. 


## What are workspaces? 
Workspaces are individual coding environments launched from within the HuBMAP Data Portal. Workspaces provide an easy way to run fast analyses of datasets. Since they are linked to individual accounts, these notebooks can be retrieved at any time.


## Why workspaces? 
We highlight three benefits of using workspaces. 
1. Use HuBMAP resources. With workspaces, you can access HuBMAP resources to run analyses. 
2. Link data to workspaces. You can link full HuBMAP datasets to these coding environments. This eliminates the need to download data to run fast analyses.
3. Availability of templates. Templates are pre-set notebooks that run analyses or show visualizations. These can help to check the quality and analyse datasets for further investigation. They are populated with the datasets linked to a workspace. You can also create your own templates.


## Starting your first workspace
It's time to start up your first workspace! The workspaces are located [here](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/workspaces)

1. Learn how to launch a workspace and link datasets by watching the Tango tutorial [here](https://portal.hubmapconsortium.org/tutorials/workspaces).
2. Navigate to the 'Workspace Tutorial datasets' sample workspace [here](https://hms-dbmi.slack.com/archives/C07MPUCM55K/p1726583699234429) and click the 'Try Sample Workspace' button.
3. The datasets that are used in the other modules of this tutorial are already available in the created workspace. You still have to upload the notebooks. Upload notebook 02_data_examination.ipynb, 03_data_retrieval.ipynb and 04_widgets_and_visualizations.ipynb to the workspace (within the Jupyter Lab environment, click the upload arrow).
